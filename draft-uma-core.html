Introduction</h3>

<p>The User-Managed Access (UMA) core protocol provides a method based
      on <a class='info' href='#OAuth2'>[OAuth2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hammer-Lahav, E., &ldquo;The OAuth 2.0 Protocol,&rdquo; 2010.</span><span>)</span></a> (currently draft 16) for users to
      control access to their protected resources, residing on any number of
      host sites, through a single authorization manager (AM) that makes
      access decisions based on user policy.
</p>
<p>For example, a web user (authorizing user) can authorize a web app
      (requester) to gain one-time or ongoing access to a resource containing
      his home address stored at a "personal data store" service (host), by
      telling the host to act on access decisions made by his authorization
      decision-making service (authorization manager or AM). The requesting
      party might be an e-commerce company whose site is acting on behalf of
      the user himself to assist him/her in arranging for shipping a purchased
      item, or it might be his friend who is using an online address book
      service to collect addresses, or it might be a survey company that uses
      an online service to compile population demographics.
</p>
<p>In enterprise settings, application access management often involves
      letting back-office applications serve only as policy enforcement points
      (PEPs), depending entirely on access decisions coming from a central
      policy decision point (PDP) to govern the access they give to
      requesters. This separation eases auditing and allows policy
      administration to scale in several dimensions. UMA makes use of a
      separation similar to this, letting the authorizing user serve as a
      policy administrator crafting authorization strategies on his or her own
      behalf.
</p>
<p>The UMA protocol profiles and extends <a class='info' href='#OAuth2'>[OAuth2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hammer-Lahav, E., &ldquo;The OAuth 2.0 Protocol,&rdquo; 2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
      An AM serves as an enhanced OAuth authorization server; a host serves as
      an enhanced resource server; and a requester serves as an enhanced
      client, acquiring an access token and the requisite authorization to
      access a protected resource at the host.
</p>
<p>UMA also defines an interoperable protection API between the AM and
      host, allowing them to reside in separate domains and allowing the host
      to establish mutual trust with an AM on behalf of a particular user.
      This API is itself OAuth-protected. Thus, the overall UMA flow has a
      second embedded OAuth-based interaction within it governing the host-AM
      relationship.
</p>
<p>UMA has the following three broad phases: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Phase 1: Protect a resource: This phase involves only the
          authorizing user, host, and AM. The authorizing user introduces a
          Host to an AM, the host obtains a host access token to use at the
          AM's protection interface, and the host tells the AM the sets of
          resources which it seeks to be protected . Phase 1 assumes that the
          user also instructs the AM what policies to attach to the registered
          resource sets, but this activity is out of band for UMA. This phase
          has no analogy with OAuth. It is described in <a class='info' href='#protecting-a-resource'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Protecting a Resource</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>Phase 2: Get authorization: This phase involves a requester for
          the first time, along with the host and AM, and it may or may not
          involve synchronous involvement by the authorizing user. This phase
          is dominated by a loop of activity in which the requester approaches
          the host seeking access, is sent to obtain an access token from the
          AM if it does not have one, and then must demonstrate to the AM that
          it satisfies the user's authorization policy governing the
          sought-for resource and scope of access if the host discovers that
          it does not have the requisite authorization. This phase is
          analogous to OAuth's "get a token" phase, though it is more
          complex.
</li>
<li>Phase 3: Access a resource: This phase involves the requester
          successfully wielding an access token that has sufficient
          authorization associated with it at the host to gain access to the
          desired resource. This phase is analogous to OAuth's "use a token"
          phase. Phases 2 and 3 together are described in <a class='info' href='#getting-authz-accessing-resource'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Getting Authorization and Accessing a Resource</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>

Getting Authorization and Accessing a Resource</h3>

<p>The main purpose of UMA is to orchestrate and control requesting
      parties' access to a user's protected resources at a host, under
      conditions dictated by that user. Thus, the core interaction in UMA
      involves a requester approaching a host and attempting the kind of
      access to a resource there that it seeks.
</p>
<p>Five pairwise interactions characterize the authorization and access
      process. The main interaction is between a requester and host, at the
      host's protected resource endpoint. The host responds to the requester's
      access request in one of several ways depending on the circumstances of
      the request, either immediately or having first performed one or more
      embedded interactions with the AM. Depending on the nature of the host's
      response to an failed access attempt, the requester itself engages in
      embedded interactions with the AM before re-attempting access. The
      pairwise interactions can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Requester-host: Attempt access at protected resource. This is the
          master interaction. The host's response, and usage of other embedded
          interactions, varies depending on whether the requester presents a
          token, whether the token is valid, and whether the token is
          associated with a scope that allows for the type of access
          sought.
</li>
<li>Requester-AM: Request an access token. Precondition:
<ul class="text">
<li>The host informed the requester which AM to get an access
              token from in its interaction #1 response.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Host-AM: Validate requester's presented access token.
          Precondition:
<ul class="text">
<li>The requester presented an access token in its interaction 1
              request.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Host-AM: Register a requested scope on the requester's behalf.
          Preconditions:
<ul class="text">
<li>The requester presented a valid access token its interaction
              #1 request.
</li>
<li>The token status returned did not include a currently
              authorized scope that covers the type of access attempted.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requester-AM: Request authorization for scoped access. The
          requester may need to provide claims to prove suitability for
          authorization. Preconditions:
<ul class="text">
<li>The host registered a scope with the AM on the requester's
              behalf in interaction #4.
</li>
<li>The host gave the requester a requested-scope ticket in its
              interaction #1 response.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This process extends OAuth in several notable ways:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The requester's access token issued in interaction #2, in the
          absence of interaction #5, signifies only a binding of this
          requester, the requesting party on whose behalf it is acting, this
          host, and this AM, to be reused for all resources and all scopes of
          access that might be sought at this host protected by this AM.
</li>
<li>Any authorizing-user consent required by policy is gathered in
          interaction #5, rather than at the time of token issuance.
</li>
<li>The process of seeking authorization does not just rely on the
          requester's ability to authenticate as the (or a) resource owner,
          but admits a wide-ranging set of policy options based on attributes
          of the requesting party. This model could be called claims-based
          authorization.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The interactions are described in detail in the following
      sections.

Requester-Host: Attempt Access at Protected Resource</h3>

<p>This interaction assumes that the host has previously registered
        with an AM one or more resource sets that correspond to the resource
        to which access is being attempted, such that the host considers this
        resource to be protected.
</p>
<p>The requester is typically attempts to access the desired resource
        at the host directly (for example, when a human operator of the
        requester software clicks on a thumbnail representation of the
        resource). The requester is expected to discover, or be provisioned
        with, knowledge of the protected resource and its location out of
        band. Further, the requester is expected to acquire its own knowledge
        about the methods made available by the host for operating on this
        resource (such as viewing it with a GET method, or transforming it
        with some complex API call) and the possible scopes of access.
</p>
<p>The host responds in one of five ways.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.1"></a><h3>2.1.1.&nbsp;
Requester's request is ambiguous</h3>

<p>By the nature of the requester's request for access (for example,
          through a URL parameter specifying a username or other identifier),
          the host needs to be able to detect uniquely which one of its users
          has the operative control over access to this resource. Without
          this, the host will be unable to interact with the correct AM using
          the correct host access token in protecting the resource.
</p>
<p>If the requester's request is ambiguous with respect to the
          specific user at the host, the host responds with an "ambiguous-user
          error" message.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>TBS</pre></div>

Requester presents no access token</h3>

<p>If the requester does not present any access token with the
          request, the host MUST return an HTTP 400 status code indicating it
          is an "invalid_request" [REF: Section 2.4.1 of OAuth Bearer Token
          draft]. This indicates to the requester one of the following: that
          the request is missing a required parameter, that it includes an
          unsupported parameter or parameter value, that it repeats the same
          parameter, that it uses more than one method for including an access
          token, or that it is otherwise malformed.

Host-AM: Validate Requester's Presented Access Token</h3>

<p>On receiving a requester's access token in an access attempt, the
        host asks the AM to validate this token. It gains authorized access to
        the AM's token validation endpoint by presenting its own host access
        token in the request to validate the requester's access token. The
        host access token also allows the host and AM to uniquely identify the
        user they have in common, and therefore allows the AM to look up the
        correct user policies and settings.
</p>
<p>The host's request to the AM is made with a POST containing the
        requester access token and the IP address of the requester's request.
        The host MAY, at its discretion, instead supply the originating IP
        address indicated in the requester's X-Forwarded-For: header value.
        The POST uses the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as
        defined by [W3C.REC-html401-19991224]. The IP address or originating
        IP address is advisory only; the AM MAY ignore it for token validation
        purposes. The host supplies its host access token with the
        request.

Requester-AM: Request Authorization for Scoped Access</h3>

<p>In this interaction the requester asks the AM to grant
        authorization to add a scope to its access token for use at a
        particular host. It does this at the AM's authorization endpoint by
        supplying the ticket it got from the host that corresponds to the
        desired scope, along with its requester access token. The AM is able
        to use this information to look up the registered requested scope,
        confirm that the correct requester is requesting the scope, mapping
        the requested scope to operative user policies, and demand in turn
        that the requester convey claims to support its request as
        necessary.
</p>
<p>The Requester performs a GET on the access token URL, using the
        standard HTTP "Accept" header to express the acceptable media type(s)
        of any claims-required list. (ISSUE#14: Need to unify the request for
        authorization with the providing of claims, so that this can be a
        single request-response pattern that can loop as required.)
</p>
<p>The AM responds in one of three ways: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the AM requires no claims from the Requester in order to
            grant authorization based on user policy, it gives success
            response, indicating that the requested scope has been associated
            with the requester's token.
</li>
<li>If the Requester is definitively not authorized according to
            user policy, the AM responds with a failure response and the
            authorization request phase ends.
</li>
<li>If user policy demands more information from the requester, the
            AM responds with a claims-required response containing a
            claims-required list. The list SHOULD use the media type that was
            indicated by the requester as acceptable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>If in this step user policy demands more information from the
        Requester and the requester received a claims-required response, then
        the requester needs to satisfy all the claims listed there. Once the
        Requester completes preparing the claims document, it performs a POST
        of that document to the authorization negotiation URL, specifying its
        type in the "Content-Type" header.
</p>
<p>If the content-type is not recognized by the AM, the AM will reject
         the document. 
         (ISSUE#15: If the content-type (of the claims response document)
         is not recognized by the AM, what happens then? 
         Should be an error from the AM.)
</p>
<p>If the AM accepts the claims document submitted by the requester,
        the AM responds with a successful or unsuccessful access token
        response, or with another claims-required response. 
        (ISSUE#16: Eventually need some special claim types that 
        allow for the trusted-claims model
        to unfold.)
</p>
<p>This specification does not define the formats of required-claims
        lists and claims documents. It may ultimately put minimum conformance
        requirements on requesters and AMs to handle particular claim formats
        defined in other specifications, as well as specifying requirements
        that claim formats seeking consideration for use in UMA must meet. One
        candidate specification for lightweight claims requests and responses
        is <a class='info' href='#Claims2.0'>Claims2.0<span> (</span><span class='info'>Maler, E., &ldquo;Claims 2.0,&rdquo; 2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [Claims2.0].

Protecting a Resource</h3>

<p>In order for a host to be able to delegate authorization to an AM,
      the authorizing sser must introduce the host to the AM. A successful
      conclusion of this phase is denoted by the following results: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The host has received metadata about the AM, such as OAuth
          endpoints.
</li>
<li>The host has received an OAuth access token (known as the host
          access token) that represents the authorizing user's approval for
          the host to work with a given AM in protecting resources. This host
          access token is used when the host makes requests at the AM's
          protection API.
</li>
<li>The AM has acquired information about resource sets on the host
          it is supposed to protect on behalf of the User.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following steps are performed by the user, host, and AM in order
      to successfully complete the first phase: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The host looks up the AM's metadata and learns about its API
          endpoints and supported formats.
</li>
<li>If the host has not yet obtained an OAuth client identifier and
          optional secret from the AM, it registers with the AM dynamically,
          for example via the UMA dynamic registration protocol (see <a class='info' href='#Dyn-Reg'>Dyn-Reg<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scholz, C., &ldquo;OAuth Dynamic Client Registration Protocol,&rdquo; 2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [Dyn&#8209;Reg]).
</li>
<li>The host obtains a host access token from the AM with the
          authorizing user's consent, by following the OAuth 2.0 authorization
          code or SAML bearer token profile.
</li>
<li>The host optionally registers scopes with the AM that are
          intended to be protected (see <a class='info' href='#reg-api'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Resource Registration API</span><span>)</span></a>).

Host Looks Up AM Metadata</h3>

<p>The host needs to learn the OAuth- and UMA-related endpoints of the
        AM before they can begin interacting. The authorizing user might
        provide the AM's location to get the Host started in this process, for
        example by typing a URL into a web form field or clicking a button.
        Alternatively, the host might already be configured to work with a
        single AM without requiring any user input. The exact process is
        beyond the scope of this specification, and it is up to the host to
        choose a method to learn the AM's location.
</p>
<p>From the data provided, discovered, or configured, the host MUST
        retrieve the hostmeta document as described in Section 2 of <a class='info' href='#hostmeta'>hostmeta<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hammer-Lahav, E., &ldquo;Web Host Metadata,&rdquo; 2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [hostmeta]. For example, if the user supplied
        "am.example.com" as the Authorization Manager's domain, the host
        creates the URL "https://am.example.com/.well-known/host-meta" and
        performs a GET request on it.

                description to a particular user by virtue of the particular host
                access token used to access the resource registration API. The host
                MAY use any identifier scheme to represent resource sets, for
                example, making its identifiers unique across all users of this host
                or allowing for the sharing of resource set identifiers among users.
                However, for privacy reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that the host assign
                an identifier that is obscured with respect to any human-readable
                resource set label used at this host. Further, this identifier MUST
                match the resource set identifier path component of the URI used to
                manage this description in the resource registration API; see <a class='info' href='#reg-api'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Resource Registration API</span><span>)</span></a> for more information. (Typically this
                matching is achieved through automatically populating the parameter
                value on initial registration of the description.)
</dd>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A human-readable string describing a
                set of one or more resources. The AM SHOULD use the name in its user
                interface to assist the user in mapping authorization constraints to
                this resource set.
</dd>
<dt>icon_uri</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A URI for a graphic icon
                representing the resource set. If provided, the AM SHOULD use the
                referenced icon in its user interface to assist the user in mapping
                authorization constraints to this resource set.
</dd>
<dt>actions</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. An array referencing one or more
                identifiers of actions that are permissible on this resource set.
                Each action identifier MUST correspond to an action registered by
                this host for this user at this AM.

<p>For example, this description characterizes a resource set
              (a photo album) that can potentially be only viewed, or alternatively
              to which full access can be granted; the URIs point to action
              descriptions, as dictated in <a class='info' href='#action-desc'>Section&nbsp;3.4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Action Descriptions</span><span>)</span></a>:

<p>Resource set descriptions descriptions MAY contain extension
            parameters that are not defined in this specification. The names of
            extension parameters MUST begin with "x-" or "X-".
</p>
<p>When a host creates or updates a resource set description (see <a class='info' href='#reg-api'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Resource Registration API</span><span>)</span></a>), the AM MUST attempt to retrieve the
            referenced action descriptions. It MAY cache such descriptions as long
            as indicated in the HTTP header for the action description resource
            unless the resource set description is subsequently updated within the
            validity period. At the beginning of an authorizing user's login session
            at the AM, the AM MUST attempt to re-retrieve action descriptions
            applying to that user whose cached versions have expired.

Resource Registration API</h3>

<p>The host uses a RESTful API at the AM's host_registration_uri to
      create, read, update, and delete resource set descriptions, along with
      listing groups of such descriptions. The host MUST use its valid host
      access token obtained previously in UMA protocol step 1 to gain access
      to the API.
</p>
<p>Individual resource set descriptions are managed at URIs with this
      structure: "{reguri}/host/{hostid}/resource_set/{resourcesetid}"
</p>
<p>The components of these URIs are defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>{reguri}</dt>
<dd>The AM's host_registration_uri as advertised
          in its metadata. This endpoint, its security requirements, and its
          requirements around advertisement in metadata are defined in UMA
          protocol step 1.
</dd>
<dt>{hostid}</dt>
<dd>A registration area at the AM that is
          specific to this host. The host MUST use the OAuth client identifier
          it was assigned by this AM as its host identifier. If the host
          identifier does not match the host access token used at the host
          registration endpoint, the AM MUST report an HTTP 403 Forbidden
          error (see example below) and fail to act on the request.
</dd>
<dt>{resourcesetid}</dt>
<dd>An identifier for a resource set
          description. The identifier MUST match the "_id" parameter value in
          the description itself.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Without a specific resource identifier path component, the URI
      applies to the set of resource set descriptions already registered.
</p>
<p>Following is a summary of the five registration API operations the AM
      is REQUIRED to support. Each is defined in its own section below. All
      other methods are unsupported.</p>

Example</h3>

<p>The following example illustrates the intent and usage of the
            resource registration protocol.
</p>
<p>This example contains some steps that are exclusively in the realm of
            user experience rather than web protocol, to achieve realistic
            illustration; these steps are labeled "User experience only". Some other
            steps are exclusively internal to the operation of the entity being
            discussed; these are labeled "Internal only".
</p>
<p>An authorizing user, Alice Adams, has just uploaded a photo of her
            new puppy to a host, Photoz.example.com, and wants to ensure that this
            specific photo is not publicly accessible.
</p>
<p>Alice has already introduced this host to her AM,
            CopMonkey.example.com, and thus Photoz has already obtained an OAuth
            client ID and an UMA host access token from CopMonkey. However, Alice
            has not previously instructed Photoz to use CopMonkey to protect any
            other photos of hers.
</p>
<p>Alice has previously visited CopMonkey to map a default "do not share
            with anyone" authorization constraint to any resource sets registered by
            Photoz, until such time as she maps some other less-draconian
            constraints to those resources. (User experience only. This may have
            been done at the time Alice introduced the host to the AM, and/or it
            could have been a global or host-specific preference setting. A
            different constraint or no constraint at all might be associated with
            newly protected resources.) Other kinds of constraints she may
            eventually map to particular photos or albums might be "Share only with
            husband@email.example.net" or "Share only with people in my 'family'
            group".
</p>
<p>Photoz itself has a publicly documented API that offers two dozen
            different methods that apply to single photos, such as "addTags" and
            "getSizes", but rolls them up into two photo-related actions: "viewing"
            (consisting of varous read-only operations) and "all" (consisting of
            various reading, editing, and printing operations). It defines two
            Web-accessible JSON-encoded documents called action descriptions that
            represent these actions, which it is able to reuse for all of its users
            (not just Alice). The "name" parameter values are intended to be seen by
            Alice when she maps authorization constraints to specific resource sets
            and actions while visiting CopMonkey, such that Alice would see the
            strings "View Photo and Related Info" and "All Actions", likely
            accompanied by the referenced icons, in the CopMonkey interface. (Other
            users of Photoz might similarly see the same labels at CopMonkey or
            whatever other AM they use.)
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>{
        "action":
            {
            "_id": "view"
            "name": "View Photo and Related Info",
            "icon_uri": "http://www.example.com/icons/reading-glasses"
        }
}</pre></div><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>{
        "action":
            {
            "_id": "all"
            "name": "All Actions",
            "icon_uri": "http://www.example.com/icons/galaxy"
        }
}</pre></div>
<p>While visiting Photoz, Alice selects a link or button that instructs
            the site to "Protect" or "Share" this single photo (user experience
            only; Photoz could have made this a default or preference setting).
</p>
<p>As a result, Photoz defines for itself a resource set that represents
            this photo (internal only; Photoz is the only application that knows how
            to map a particular photo to a particular resource set). Photoz also
            prepares the following resource set description, which is specific to
            Alice and her photo. The "name" parameter value is intended to be seen
            by Alice in mapping authorization constraints to specific resource sets
            and actions when she visits CopMonkey, such that Alice would see the
            string "Steve the puppy!", likely accompanied by the referenced icon, in
            the CopMonkey interface. The possible actions on this resource set are
            indicated with URI references to the action descriptions, as defined
            just above.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>{
        "resource_set":
            {
            "_id": "112210f47de98100"
            "name": "Steve the puppy!",
            "icon_uri": "http://www.example.com/icons/flower",
            "actions":
                        ["http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/view",
                        "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/all"]
        }
}</pre></div>
<p>Photoz uses the "create resource set description" method of
            CopMonkey's standard UMA-based resource registration API, presenting its
            Alice-specific host access token there, to register and assign an
            identifier to the resource set description. The resource set identifier
            path component of the URL matches the "_id" parameter value in the
            description.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>PUT /host/photoz.example.com/resource/112210f47de98100
Content-Type: application/json
...

{
        "resource_set":
           {
           "_id": "112210f47de98100"
           "name": "Steve the puppy!",
           "icon_uri": "http://www.example.com/icons/flower",
           "actions":
                        ["http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/view",
                        "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/all"]
         }
}</pre></div>
<p>Once this description has been successfully registered, Photoz is
            responsible for responding to requesters' attempts to access this photo,
            achieving protection of the resource by "outsourcing" this task to
            CopMonkey.
</p>
<p>At the time Alice indicates she would like this photo protected,
            Photoz can choose to redirect Alice to CopMonkey for further
            authorization constraint mapping, access auditing, and other AM-related
            tasks (user experience only).
</p>
<p>Over time, as Alice uploads other photos and creates and organizes
            photo albums, and as Photoz makes new action functionality available,
            Photoz can use additional methods of the resource registration API to
            ensure that CopMonkey's understanding of Alice's protected resources
            matches its own.

<p>Ultimately the host is responsible for either granting the access the

      of these error responses, but requires the host to "outsource" the
      determination of some error conditions to the AM.

<p>The host is responsible for determining "insufficient_scope". If the
      requester's attempted access does not match any of the scopes returned
      by the AM in its valid-token response to the host, the host returns an

<p>If the client request to the Authorization Manager endpoint is invalid,
        the Authorization Manager constructs the error response by adding the
        following parameters to the entity body of the HTTP response using the
        "application/json" media type:

        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>error</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A single error code. Value for this
            parameter is defined in the specific AM endpoint description
</dd>
<dt>error_description</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A human-readable text providing
            additional information, used to assist in the understanding and resolution
            of the error occurred.
</dd>
<dt>error_uri</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A URI identifying a human-readable web
            page with information about the error, used to provide the end-user with
            additional information about the error.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Common error codes:
</p>
<p> The request is missing a required parameter or
        is otherwise malformed.  The AM MUST respond with the HTTP 400 (Bad Request)
        status code.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
          HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
          Content-Type: application/json
          Cache-Control: no-store
          {
              {
                  "error":"invalid_request",
                  "error_description":"There is already a resource with this identifier.",
                  "error_uri":"http://am.example.com/errors/resource_exists"
              }
          }</pre></div>

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
      See <a class='info' href='#RFC3552'>RFC 3552<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E. and B. Korver, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3552] for a guide.
</p>
<p>This specification relies mainly on OAuth security mechanisms for
      protecting the host registration endpoint at the AM so that only a
      properly authorized host can access it on behalf of the intended user.
      For example, the host needs to use a valid host access token issued
      through a user authorization process at the endpoint, and the
      interaction should take place over TLS. It is expected that the host
      will protect its client secret (if it was issued one) and will protect
      its host access token, particularly if used in "bearer token"
      fashion.
</p>
<p>In addition, this specification dictates a binding between the host
      access token and the host-specific registration area on the AM to
      prevent a host from interacting with a registration area not its
      own.
</p>
<p>(ISSUE#18: Other stuff goes here too. Provide commentary on any
      requirements layered on the forthcoming OAuth security considerations
      section; discuss UMA-layer implications for more meaningful
      authentication of requesters/requesting parties; discuss implications of
      user-mediated AM/host trust model; discuss short-lived token technique
      for lightweight requester correlation...)

<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;
Privacy Considerations</h3>

<p>The AM comes to be in possession of resource set information (such as
      names and icons) that may reveal information about the user, which the
      AM's trust relationship with the host is assumed to accommodate.
      However, the requester is a less-trusted party (in fact, entirely
      untrustworthy until it acquires a requester access token in UMA protocol
      step 2). This specification recommends obscuring resource set
      identifiers in order to avoid leaking personally identifiable
      information to requesters through the "scope" mechanism.
</p>
<p>(ISSUE#19: Other stuff goes here too. More privacy considerations.)

<a name="rfc.section.8"></a><h3>8.&nbsp;
Conformance</h3>

<p>This section outlines conformance requirements for various entities
      implementing UMA endpoints. Currently two levels of conformance are
      defined: minimal and full. (Other types or levels may ultimately be
      defined in this specification or in other specifications that profile or
      extend this one.)
</p>
<p>This specification has dependencies on other specifications, as
      follows:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>OAuth 2.0: AMs, hosts, and requesters MUST support OAuth 2.0
          features named in this specification for minimal conformance. For
          example, features related to refresh tokens, client secrets, and the
          web server profile are mentioned and support for them is
          REQUIRED.
</li>
<li>Dynamic registration: For full conformance, AMs MUST support
          dynamic registration. For minimal conformance, AMs are not required
          to support dynamic registration. Hosts need not support the
          requesting of dynamic registration at either conformance level.
</li>
<li>Resource registration: For minimal conformance, AMs and hosts
          MUST support resource registration.
</li>
</ul>

Issues</h3>

<p>Catalog of issues (some noted within the text above as well,
      indicated by "ISSUE"):</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>ISSUE#01: Need to specify options for claim formats in the XRD.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#02: Need to clarify how the requester's user authorization endpoint
          would be used in an UMA (vs. an OAuth) fashion for collecting
          synchronous authorizing user consent in Phase 2, based on a
          privileged type of claim request.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#03: Do we need to specify explicitly a means for the requester to get
          a new or refreshed access token from the AM, or can we mostly just
          refer to OAuth for this? Right now this interaction type doesn't
          have its own section.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#04: Need to specify the format of the token validation request
          message. Can Maciej supply what they're using?
</li>
<li>ISSUE#05: When the token is invalid, what's the current OAuth thinking on
          what we should return? Is there any reason not to copy OAuth as
          closely as possible in this case? Or should a token status of
          "invalid" be used, and returned as success (unifying the different
          kinds of responses to the validation request)?
</li>
<li>ISSUE#06: Need to complete the design of the requested-scope registration
          interaction and its associated error messages.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#07: Need to complete the design of the authorization request
          interaction and its associated error messages.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#08: Sort out whether resource set descriptions are supposed to use
          scope URIs or scope identifiers! It's inconsistent now.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#09: Move the resource registration API section to be a subsection
          under the previous big section.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#10: Copy over the resource set description and scope description
          content.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#11:Refer to OAuth processes for getting a token
          "autonomously" here? Currently there is no section for the
          requester-AM token-getting interaction. 
          RESOLUTION#11: a new section has been added, to discuss
          about the usage of OAuth flow for the requester 
          to gen a token from the AM.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#12:  If the the AM finds the requester's access token to be invalid,
          it returns an UMA error message (ISSUE#12: correct? HTTP success?) to
          indicate that the requester's token is invalid.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#13: How to structure the body to
        include the scope and also the requester's access token?
</li>
<li>ISSUE#14: Need to unify the request for
        authorization with the providing of claims, so that this can be a
        single request-response pattern that can loop as required.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#15: If the content-type (of the claims response document)
        is not recognized by the AM, what happens then? 
        Should be an error from the AM.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#16: Eventually need some special claim types that 
        allow for the trusted-claims model to unfold.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#17: fill in. Need to say what claims format is supported.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#18: Provide commentary on any
          requirements layered on the forthcoming OAuth security considerations
          section; discuss UMA-layer implications for more meaningful
          authentication of requesters/requesting parties; discuss implications of
          user-mediated AM/host trust model; discuss short-lived token technique
          for lightweight requester correlation...
</li>
<li>ISSUE#19: Other stuff goes here too. More privacy considerations.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#20: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: 
          Rev8 Section 2.2: +1 for validation request in json format 
          instead of application/x-www-form-urlencoded. 
</li>
<li>ISSUE#21: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: 
          Rev8 Section 2.4: AM adds a scope to the requester's access token. 
          Maybe I am missing something but I don't see the explanation in the 
          spec how requester's token is issued at first. 
          I think some parts are mutual for the host and the requester 
          i.e. AM Discovery, optional Dynamic Client Registration.  
</li>
<li>ISSUE#22: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: 
          Rev8 Section 3.4.2: Example is missing required '_id' parameter.  
          ACTION#22: '_id' parameter added.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#23: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: 
          Rev8 Section 4: 403 Forbidden response when: 'unsupported method or host ID 
          not matching the presented host access token'. 
          I think AM should return 403 in case of performing operations on 
          resources of different user (not owned resources at this same host), 
          instead of returning 404 Not Found to not disclose 
          presence of the resource set at the AM. 
</li>
<li>ISSUE#24: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: 
          Rev8 Section 4.1: Empty response body? 
          In SAM we return 'resource_id' and 'policy_uri' 
          so that the host can redirect the user to 
          the policy definition page (sharing setting screen) on AM. 
</li>
<li>ISSUE#25: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: 
        Section 4.1 - what happens when a resource (being registered) already exists?
</li>
<li>ISSUE#26: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: 
          Section 4.1 to 4.4: URLs in the examples mistakenly contains '/user/{userid}'.
          ACTION#26: examples have been corrected.
</li>
<li>ISSUE#27: Can Update Resource Set Description API 
          mistakenly overwrite/destroy an existing
          resource description?.  (<a class='info' href='#update-resource-set'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Update Resource Set Description</span><span>)</span></a>)
